# Overview

This is the calculator project from Paul Hegarty's Stanford CS193p Winter 2017 course _"Developing iOS 10 Apps with Swift."_

## Unit Testing

Unit testing isn't covered in the on-line course which is, IMHO, a shame really because I believe good unit testing is an important component to any project. Not only does it help simplify development testing but it also quickly validates changes made to a project. I added unit tests for both the calculator back-end model and the user interface. The model and UI unit tests are in CalculatorTests and CalculatorUITests, respectively.
